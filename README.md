## Dao & Norm
* Dao - A ColdFusion library for easy and db agnostic CRUD interaction and Linq style query building.
* Norm (Not ORM) - A dynamic Object Mapping layer built on top of DAO that provides oData support and ORM style object interactions (load, save, relate entities, etc...).

## Elevator Pitch
Dao/Norm is a duo of libraries that provide a simple yet full featured interface to perform script based queries as well as adds extended functionality such as ORM (with easy and dynamic relationships), oData (Consume/Produce), LINQ style queries and more.  Basically it is the data interaction ColdFusion/Railo/Lucee should have come with out of the box.

In short, the goal of this library is to allow one to interact with the database in a DB platform agnostic way, while making it super easy.

## Requirements
Currently this library has been actively used and tested on Lucee 4x, 5.x, CF11+

## Installation
### Manual
Clone this repo and copy the "database" folder `(/database)` into your project (or into the folder you place your components)
### CommandBox
`box install dao`

### Examples
#### DAO
```ActionScript
dao = new database.dao();
dao.update("sometable",form);
```
```ActionScript
function getUsers(){
	// normally injected or in applicaiton scope
	dao = new database.dao();
	return dao.read(
		sql = "
			SELECT fname as firstName, lname as lastName
			FROM Users
		",
		returnType = "array"
	);
}
writeOutput( getUsers() );
```
Output:
```JavaScript
[
	{"firstName":"Jill","lastName":"Smith"},
	{"firstName":"Joe","lastName":"Blow"},
	{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Cash"}
]
```
#### LINQ
```ActionScript
dao.from( "eventLog" )
		.where( "eventDate", "<", now() )
		.andWhere( "eventDate", ">=", dateAdd( 'd', -1, now() ) )
	.run();
```
#### Norm
```ActionScript
User = new database.Norm("user");
User.loadByFirstName("joe");
User.setStatus("online");
User.save();
```
