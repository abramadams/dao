    "shortDescription":"A ColdFusion library for easy Data Access, CRUD, ORM like functionality and LINQ style query building.",
    "description":"Dao/Norm is a duo of libraries that provide a simple yet full featured interface to perform script based queries as well as adds extended functionality such as ORM (with easy and dynamic relationships), oData (Consume/Produce), LINQ style queries and more. Basically it is the data interaction ColdFusion/Railo/Lucee should have come with out of the box. In short, the goal of this library is to allow one to interact with the database in a DB platform agnostic way, while making it super easy.",
